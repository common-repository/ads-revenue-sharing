A AdSense revenue-sharing plugin, allowing site owners and users to customize ad settings, manage ad positions, and control ad shares seamlessly.

== Description ==

AdSense Revenue Sharing is a simple and easy-to-use plugin that allows website administrators to share Google AdSense revenue with contributors or authors who write posts on the site. You can customize the percentage of ads displayed for each user, allowing them to earn part of the revenue generated from their content.

### Key Features:
- Customize the percentage of ad display for each user via the settings panel.
- Display site owner ads if the user doesn't provide AdSense info.
- Support for multiple ad placements (Top of the article, Bottom of the article, or both).
- Set AdSense configurations per user via their profile settings.
- Automatically generate an ads.txt file based on site and user settings.
- Display fallback ads from the site owner if a user hasn't configured their AdSense details.
- Now supports both Arabic and English.

### New in Version 1.4.1:
- Custom Code Support: All ad placements now allow for custom ad codes or AdSense ads.
- Footer Popup Ad: Footer ad can now be displayed as a popup with either AdSense or custom code.
- Tabbed Ad Management: All ad settings are now organized into separate tabs for each ad placement, simplifying management.

### New in Version 1.4:
- **Multilingual Support**: Plugin now supports both English and Arabic.
- **New Ad Placements**: Ads can be placed at the top, bottom, and after any paragraph (up to four custom positions).
- **Custom End Ad**: A customizable ad that can either display AdSense or another company’s ad.
- **Website URL Added**: A website link field has been added to the admin settings.
